# Kubernetes concepts

- Kubernetes is a container management system

- It runs and manages containerized applications on a cluster

--

- What does that really mean?

---

## What can we do with Kubernetes?

- Let's imagine that we have a 3-tier e-commerce app:

  - web frontend

  - API backend

  - database (that we will keep out of Kubernetes for now)

- We have built images for our frontend and backend components

  (e.g. with Dockerfiles and `docker build`)

- We are running them successfully with a local environment

  (e.g. with Docker Compose)

- Let's see how we would deploy our app on Kubernetes!

---


## Basic things we can ask Kubernetes to do

--

- Start 5 containers using image `atseashop/api:v1.3`

--

- Place an internal load balancer in front of these containers

--

- Start 10 containers using image `atseashop/webfront:v1.3`

--

- Place a public load balancer in front of these containers

--

- It's Black Friday (or Christmas), traffic spikes, grow our cluster and add containers

--

- New release! Replace my containers with the new image `atseashop/webfront:v1.4`

--

- Keep processing requests during the upgrade; update my containers one at a time

---

## Other things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Autoscaling

  (straightforward on CPU; more complex on other metrics)

- Resource management and scheduling

  (reserve CPU/RAM for containers; placement constraints)

- Advanced rollout patterns

  (blue/green deployment, canary deployment)

---

## More things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Batch jobs

  (one-off; parallel; also cron-style periodic execution)

- Fine-grained access control

  (defining *what* can be done by *whom* on *which* resources)

- Stateful services

  (databases, message queues, etc.)

- Automating complex tasks with *operators*

  (e.g. database replication, failover, etc.)

## Kubernetes architecture

- Ha ha ha ha

- OK, I was trying to scare you, it's much simpler than that ❤️

## Kubernetes architecture: the nodes

- The nodes executing our containers run a collection of services:

  - a container Engine (typically Docker or containerd)

  - kubelet (the "node agent")

  - kube-proxy (the "network agent")

- Nodes, also called "worker nodes" were formerly called "minions"

  (You might see that word in older articles or documentation)

---

## Kubernetes architecture: the control plane

- The Kubernetes logic (its "brains") is a collection of services:

  - the API server (our point of entry to everything!)

  - core services like the scheduler and controller manager

  - `etcd` (a highly available key/value store; the "database" of Kubernetes)

- Together, these services form the control plane of our cluster

- The control plane was previously called the "master"

## How many nodes should a cluster have?

- There is no particular constraint

  (no need to have an odd number of nodes for quorum)

- A cluster can have zero node

  (but then it won't be able to start any pods)

- For testing and development, having a single node is fine

- For production, make sure that you have extra capacity

  (so that your workload still fits if you lose a node or a group of nodes)

- Kubernetes is tested with [up to 5000 nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/)

  (however, running a cluster of that size requires a lot of tuning)

## Do we need to run Docker at all in Kubernetes?

No!

--

- Docker actually runs containers with "containerd", which is built by Docker

- Docker Engine has more features than Kubernetes needs, and containerd is lighter

- By default, Kubernetes uses containerd to run containers

- We can leverage other pluggable runtimes through the *Container Runtime Interface*

---

class: extra-details

## Some runtimes available through CRI

- [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/README.md)

  - maintained by Docker, IBM, and community
  - used by Docker Engine, microk8s, k3s, GKE; also standalone
  - comes with its own CLI, `ctr`

- [CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/master/README.md):

  - maintained by Red Hat, SUSE, and community
  - used by OpenShift and Kubic
  - designed specifically as a minimal runtime for Kubernetes

- [And more](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/)

## Do we need to run Docker at all in Kubernetes?

Sometimes!

--

- Docker CLI/Engine are now focused on local development workflows

- Docker Engine = Human friendly CLI
  
- containerd & CRI-O = Machine friendly, ideal for controlling from Kubernetes

- Kubernetes doesn't build images or support `docker compose`

- You might see Docker Engine used to support building images in Kubernetes

---

class: extra-details

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

- On our Kubernetes clusters:

  *Not anymore*

- On our development environments, CI pipelines ... :

  *Yes, almost certainly*

- On our production servers:

  *Probably not*

---

## Interacting with Kubernetes

- We will interact with our Kubernetes cluster through the Kubernetes API

- The Kubernetes API is (mostly) RESTful

- It allows us to create, read, update, delete *resources*

- A few common resource types are:

  - node (a machine — physical or virtual — in our cluster)

  - pod (group of containers running together on a node)

  - service (stable network endpoint to connect to one or multiple containers)

## Scaling

- How would we scale the pod shown on the previous slide?

- **Do** create additional pods

  - each pod can be on a different node

  - each pod will have its own IP address

- **Do not** add more NGINX containers in the pod

  - all the NGINX containers would be on the same node

  - they would all have the same IP address
    <br/>(resulting in `Address alreading in use` errors)

---

## Together or separate

- Should we put e.g. a web application server and a cache together?
  <br/>
  ("cache" being something like e.g. Memcached or Redis)

- Putting them **in the same pod** means:

  - they have to be scaled together

  - they can communicate very efficiently over `localhost`

- Putting them **in different pods** means:

  - they can be scaled separately

  - they must communicate over remote IP addresses
    <br/>(incurring more latency, lower performance)

- Both scenarios can make sense, depending on our goals
